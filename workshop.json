  "Description": "This is a fork of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1804499742] egocarib's QudUX[/url], temporary until they come back likely after 1.0.\n[b]Works on version 205+ and beta onwards[/b]\n\nTo play on the beta right click the game on Steam -> properties -> beta and choose your version (either 205 or beta, which will sync you with latest beta changes).\n\n[h1]Notes[/h1]\nImproved Inventory, Disabling Autopickup, Visited Locations, Trader Restock, Legendary Mark all work (other features are superseded by new basegame changes or removed).\n\nIf the last two don't work:\n\n- The marking will work if you [L]ook the legendary once, press space, save to the main menu and continue your save without closing the game.\n- Same with the Locate quest givers option. Talk to someone that can tell you if there is quest givers, save to main menu, reload and the option will be there.\nYou seem to only need to do this once per opening of the game and it will work for all other encounters, but do again if needed.\n\n[url=https://github.com/MoustaphaElPsyCongroo/Gokudera_ElPsyCongroo_CavesOfQud-QudUX-v2_TempFork]Github link of the fork[/url]",
